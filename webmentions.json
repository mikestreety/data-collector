        "html": "<p><strong>On The Side has been abuzz this week with blogs about music, CDs and DVDs. <a href=\"https://samdking.co.uk/blog/2023-01-13-my-maximalist-media-habit/\">Sam</a>, <a href=\"https://www.trovster.com/blog/2023/01/discovering-music\">Trev</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.nocturnalmonkey.com/reclaiming-my-likes-playlist/\">Sam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mikestreety.co.uk/blog/why-i-miss-the-limitations-of-cd-players/\">Mike</a> have all chimed in with their personal opinions, dividing the community on how physical media is appreciated in a digital culture. Here are my thoughts…</strong></p>\n<h2>Rewind</h2>\n<p>As a millennial (just about), I grew up with vinyl, cassettes and CDs to consume music (let’s not talk radio or TV – that’s a whole other debate). My parents collected their own music libraries across all formats; dad with his rock and electronic music, mum with her pop, disco and soul.</p>\n<p>I have fond memories of my dad’s first portable Kenwood CD player sent from his brother in Japan along with Eurythmics, Fine Young Cannibals and Status Quo as a starting collection. It plugged into his Kenwood stack hifi he meticulously looked after, along with the delightfully clear speaker system he’d spent months shopping around for and fine-tuning (”don’t touch that equaliser, Simon!”)</p>\n<p>The weekends were the time we’d all listen along to one of their albums from the collection; mum screaming along to Whitney tunes, dad head-bopping along to the bass lines of his deeper selection. We’d also spend many road trips heading up and down the M1 to Derby playing cassettes on loop. Carribean Queen is a distinct memory in Mum’s car along with Bomb The Bass in dad’s.</p>\n<p>We’d sing or hum along knowing the words after learning them from the album liners, playing them relentlessly, almost rote learning every lyric written in sequential order.</p>\n<p>These were the days of well crafted albums, when you KNEW what was coming next from the artist’s (or producers’) compilation.</p>\n<p>Music was treated as the craft it deserves by the listeners.</p>\n<h2>Crate-Digging</h2>\n<p>As I grew older and started earning an income, this love and passion for music continued when I’d spend most my money in HMV and Virgin Megastore. Many a weekend would be spent in Northampton shopping centre, flipping through aisles of CDs and vinyl, selecting the most valuable choice with my limited funds. (These were the days when singles would range from 99p to £3.99 on CD, some limited edition vinyl could cost over £10).</p>\n<p>I grew my collection over years of browsing the stores, often spending hours alone hogging one of the record players, trying to find THAT track that captured me to be repeated endlessly on loop.</p>\n<p>This hobby continued as I went to university, often spending my menial student loan (and overdraft) on records over decent food – beans on toast was substantial enough to allow for another record. I used to jump in the car with my (employed) DJ friends, head up to Leeds or other nearby cities to pull apart HMV’s biggest record collections for that one-in-a-thousand tune to play at our next gig.</p>\n<p>I’m hopefully painting a romantic picture here, a true love for music that was tangible, unique, a real craft of art.</p>\n<p>Then MP3s came along.</p>\n<h2>Digital Love</h2>\n<p>Now don’t get me wrong. The digital revolution was a game-changer in many ways. With the internet came access to content that was typically inaccessible to most (thanks Tim). Obviously piracy was a serious issue, really challenging the music industry to adapt quickly and maintain control/income of their productions for their artist’s royalties. Mass produced music was feeling the pain when MP3s were gaining popularity, with early MP3 players quickly filling up with multiple albums.</p>\n<p>Back in our university dorms, we’d use Napster or Kazaa quickly downloading the biggest hits for our parties, burning collections to CD for others to enjoy later. It was terrible looking back but with little-to-no income and students need to “live life to the full”, it became common practice for many to abuse this new-found access to music.</p>\n<p>But whilst the masses enjoyed popular music, I was also spending many evenings browsing specialist directories and forums for my favourite genre: house music.

        "text": "On The Side has been abuzz this week with blogs about music, CDs and DVDs. Sam, Trev, Sam and Mike have all chimed in with their personal opinions, dividing the community on how physical media is appreciated in a digital culture. Here are my thoughts…\nRewind\nAs a millennial (just about), I grew up with vinyl, cassettes and CDs to consume music (let’s not talk radio or TV – that’s a whole other debate). My parents collected their own music libraries across all formats; dad with his rock and electronic music, mum with her pop, disco and soul.\nI have fond memories of my dad’s first portable Kenwood CD player sent from his brother in Japan along with Eurythmics, Fine Young Cannibals and Status Quo as a starting collection. It plugged into his Kenwood stack hifi he meticulously looked after, along with the delightfully clear speaker system he’d spent months shopping around for and fine-tuning (”don’t touch that equaliser, Simon!”)\nThe weekends were the time we’d all listen along to one of their albums from the collection; mum screaming along to Whitney tunes, dad head-bopping along to the bass lines of his deeper selection. We’d also spend many road trips heading up and down the M1 to Derby playing cassettes on loop. Carribean Queen is a distinct memory in Mum’s car along with Bomb The Bass in dad’s.\nWe’d sing or hum along knowing the words after learning them from the album liners, playing them relentlessly, almost rote learning every lyric written in sequential order.\nThese were the days of well crafted albums, when you KNEW what was coming next from the artist’s (or producers’) compilation.\nMusic was treated as the craft it deserves by the listeners.\nCrate-Digging\nAs I grew older and started earning an income, this love and passion for music continued when I’d spend most my money in HMV and Virgin Megastore. Many a weekend would be spent in Northampton shopping centre, flipping through aisles of CDs and vinyl, selecting the most valuable choice with my limited funds. (These were the days when singles would range from 99p to £3.99 on CD, some limited edition vinyl could cost over £10).\nI grew my collection over years of browsing the stores, often spending hours alone hogging one of the record players, trying to find THAT track that captured me to be repeated endlessly on loop.\nThis hobby continued as I went to university, often spending my menial student loan (and overdraft) on records over decent food – beans on toast was substantial enough to allow for another record. I used to jump in the car with my (employed) DJ friends, head up to Leeds or other nearby cities to pull apart HMV’s biggest record collections for that one-in-a-thousand tune to play at our next gig.\nI’m hopefully painting a romantic picture here, a true love for music that was tangible, unique, a real craft of art.\nThen MP3s came along.\nDigital Love\nNow don’t get me wrong. The digital revolution was a game-changer in many ways. With the internet came access to content that was typically inaccessible to most (thanks Tim). Obviously piracy was a serious issue, really challenging the music industry to adapt quickly and maintain control/income of their productions for their artist’s royalties. Mass produced music was feeling the pain when MP3s were gaining popularity, with early MP3 players quickly filling up with multiple albums.\nBack in our university dorms, we’d use Napster or Kazaa quickly downloading the biggest hits for our parties, burning collections to CD for others to enjoy later. It was terrible looking back but with little-to-no income and students need to “live life to the full”, it became common practice for many to abuse this new-found access to music.\nBut whilst the masses enjoyed popular music, I was also spending many evenings browsing specialist directories and forums for my favourite genre: house music. This was an opportunity for aspiring DJs and producers to share their creations with dedicated fans, getting immediate feedback without the high cost and commitment of record presses or label distribution contracts.\nDigital music enabled artists with rapid distribution & faster feedback whilst listeners had immediate easy access to endless choices across the globe.\nAs I graduated from university and found a job, online stores were starting to provide more platforms for DJs to browse new music and reward artists with a suitable income.
